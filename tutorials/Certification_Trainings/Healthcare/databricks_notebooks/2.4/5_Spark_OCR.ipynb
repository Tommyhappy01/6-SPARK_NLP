Harvard prof believes it\n\nExperiences with extraterrestrials real, he says\n\nBY ANNE THOMPSON\nAssociated Press\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dr. John\nMack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has\nnever had sex with a space alien, nor\ndoes he care to. It could compromise\nhis objectivity.\n\nMack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,\nfirmly believes those people who say\nthey had extremely close encounters\nwith beings from other worlds.\n\nAnd in his new book, “Abduc-\ntion,” he relates his findings after\nspending four years studying 120\n“experiencers” — people who say\nthey had sexual or reproductive ex-\nperiences with aliens who abducted\nthem and took them aboard space-\nships.\n\nThe 13 case studies in his book\ninclude Ed, who remembers an alien\nwomar taking a sperm sample from\nhim when he was in high school;\nJerry, who says she gave birth to a\nhuman-alien hybrid; and Peter, who\ntells Mack he had an “alien wife” in a\n“parallel universe.”\n\n“There is a consistent reproduc-\ntive theme,” Mack said. “Now, do I\nmean by that literally there are mil-\nlions of babies being made? I don’t\nknow. I can'’t claim that this is occur-\n\nring literally in our physical dimen-\nsion of reality.”\n\nWhat Mack does claim is that\nexperiencers are not mentally ill and\nare not working out the effects of\nrape, incest or other abuse. Their\nemotional and psychological state\nresembles trauma, he said, and trau-\nma is the response to something\noutside the body, not inside the mind.\n\n“They don’t want to believe it any\nmore than we do,” he said. “They\nwant me to find them crazy.”\n\nDescriptions of abductions are\nconsistent from patient to patient,\nMack said. So he believes the exper-\niencers, even if he can't explain\nexactly what they experienced.\n\nOne of Mack’s patients, a 37-year-\nold undercover debunker, told Time\nmagazine that Mack gave her UFO\nliterature to read before he hypno-\ntized her.\n\n“John made it obvious what he\nwanted to hear,” the patient, Donna\nBassett, said. “I provided the an-\nswers.”\n\nMack could not be located to\nrespond to Bassett’s allegations, He\ndeclined to comment to the magazine\nabout her case.\n\nHis accomplishments include\n\nfounding the psychiatry department\nat the Harvard-affiliated Cambridge\nHospital and winning a 1977 Pulitzer\nfor his psychoanalytic biography of\nT.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia).\n\nSince then, Mack has developed\nan interest in Eastern philosophy and\nreligion, and believes it helped liber-\nate his thinking.\n\n“We don’t have room in our cul-\nture for this. It's the elite people, my\ncolleagues, who decide what we're\nsupposed to believe,” he said, “and to\nthem this isn’t supposed to be.”\n\nEven Mack’s fellow researchers\ninto the otherworldly think “Abduc-\ntion” is a little, well, out there.\n\nDr. William McCal, a physician in\nAnaheim, Calif., said that for 10 years\nhe used hypnosis to evaluate exper-\niencers. His theory: They're actually\nremembering being born. People’s\nmemories of going aboard spacecraft\nmatch their hypnosis-evoked memo-\nries of passing through the birth\ncanal, he said.\n\nBudd Hopkins, a pioneer in UFO\nabduction research, said that while\nhe agrees with Mack that these\npeople had sexual encounters with\naliens, he has reservations about\nMack’s counseling of people to see\n\n \n\n \n\nSUSAN WALSH/ASSOCTIATED PRESS\nDr. John Mack, ¢ Harvard psychi-\natrist, says sexual experiences\nwith extraterrestrials are real.\n\nthe experience as somehow enrich-\ning.

That’s the same number of Americans\nthat cigarettes kill every 24 hours.”\n\nThe CEOs were not impressed.\n\n“We have looked at the data. ...

No\nlonger hamstrung by tobacco-state seniority\nand the deep-pocketed tohacco lobby,\nCongress is taking aim at cigarette makers.\n\n \n\nThe tobacco industry would like to promote\nthe specter of prohibition.\n\n“If cigarettes are too dangerous 1o be sold,\nthen ban them.

He knows cigarettes are not\ngoing to be banned, at least not in his lifetime.\nWhat he really fears are new taxcs, stronger\nanti-smoking campaigns, further smoking\nrestrictions, limits on secondhand smoke and\nlimits on tar and nicotine.\n\nCollectively, these steps can accelerate the\ncurrent 5 percent annual decline in cigarette\nuse and turn the tobacco business from highly\nprofitable to depressed.\n\nJohnson’s comment about cigarettes “‘made\nof who knows what” was comical.\n\nThe day before the hearing, the tobacco\ncompanies released a long-secret list of 599\nadditives used in cigarettes. The companies\nsaid all are certified by an “independent\n\n \n\npancl” of toxicologists as “not hazardous\nunder the conditions they are used.”\n\nPeople not paid by the tobacco companies\naren't so sure.

Russian\nnewspapers did not cover the case.\nMost in her community told her she\nwas crazy.\n\n“Unfortunately,” Smyshlayeva\nsaid, “around here even husbands\nthink this kind of behavior is nor-\nmal.” But her husband supported\nher, as did the district prosecutor,\nwho opened an investigation in Janu-\nary.\n\nThe case against the doctor was\ndropped before trial, however, under\nthe general amnesty last February\nthat freed Alexander Rutskoi, a\nleader of the October insurrection\nagainst President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nSmyshlayeva remains employed\nby the clinic, as does her former\nsupervisor, although he was sus-\npended from his position as chief.\n\nThe feminist movement in Russia\nremains small, and if anything, it is\nin decline; its few active members\ncomplain that the status of women\nhas only deteriorated since the de-\nmise of Communism.\n\nOn average, women in 1991 earned\n75 percent as much as men, accord-\ning to the Center for Gender Studies\nin Moscow, but now that figure has\ndropped to 40 percent. Unemploy-\nment is three times higher among\nwomen than among men. Though\nthere are no reliable statistics, wom-\nen’s groups say domestic violence is\nsoaring. The first registered rape\nrecovery center and a crisis hot line\nfor abused women recently opened\nin Moscow.\n\nMost Russian men dismiss the\nissue of sexual harassment as yet\nanother silly Western hang-up. Most\nwomen say the problem exists, but\nshrug it off as just another unpleas-\nant fact of life.\n\nThe demeaning jokes and sala-\ncious remarks that are increasingly\nconsidered a form of harassment in\nthe United States are so common-\nplace in Russia that they do not\nregister as harassment.\n\nValentina Konstantinova, a re-\nsearcher at the Center for Gender\nStudies, noted that while in Commu-\nnist times, bosses preyed on employ-\nees with impunity, democracy has\nmainly freed the male libido.\n\n“Before the view of Russian men\nwere as creatures without willpower\nwho drink too much. Now they have\n\nceived many formal complaints.\n“The pay at Western companies is so\nmuch higher,” he said, “that most\nwomen just smile and bear it.”\n\nThere are no feminist newspapers,\nand only one women’s magazine, the\nmonthly, distinctly unglossy Female\nWorker. But a Russian edition of\nCosmopolitan, a magazine known\nmore for advising women on the arts\nof seduction than on how to fight off\nan amorous boss, is scheduled to hit\nthe stands in Russia at the end of the\nmonth.\n\nIts publisher, Derk Sauer, who also\nowns The Moscow Times, described\nhis project as a service to newly\nprosperous Russian women. “The\nmagazine will not just be ahout\nfashion,” he said. “It’s about relation-\nships and careers and sex.”\n\nAnd sexual mores have changed.\nThere are more and more women,\nfemninists say, who freely trade sex-\nual favors for salary and perks,\nbecause good jobs are scarce and\nemployers can more easily replace\nrecalcitrant or older employees than\nthey could under Communism.\n\nJob seekers who do not wish to\nsleep with their employers attach a\npostscript to their advertisements,\nintim nye predlagat, “no intimate\nrelations.”\n\nThe current hedonism repels Dmi-\ntri Babich, a young reporter for the\ndaily Komsomolskaya Pravda. He\nwas s0 appalled by a recent televi-\nsion advertisement for office equip-\nment that depicted a secretary lean-\ning over her leering boss, her breasts\nexposed, that he put his phone num-\nber in an article and asked women\nwho had experienced sexual harass-\nment to call.\n\n“A fourth of the calls were from\nmen thinking it was an ad for phone\nsex,” he said.\n\nHis editors were equally confused\nabout the article he planned. “They\nscheduled it for an erotic supple-\nment,” he said.\n\nHe eventually dissuaded them.
